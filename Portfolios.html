                <h3> Budgeting made easy with Possible Investments </h3>
                <br><br>
                <p>Before you can invest, it is imperative to know what you spend. Possible Investments utilises a deep
                    and intuitve AI feature that allows us to quickly help you get
                    on top of your spending. It's imperative that you can make the most out of your earnings, and
                    coupled with that is knowing you can save for a rainy day.
                    Many people start with the costs of their day to day expenses to keep a roof over their heads. This
                    is getting tougher, with inflation running rampant and interest rates skyrocketing:</p><br>

                <h3><i>Possible Investments overall Investment Philosophy and Vision</i></h3> <a
                    href="./Assets/Philosophy-Po8ible1.pdf">Investment Philosophy</a><br>

                Watch this space: Possible Investments is being launched shortly, and will have a basic initial
                client
                portal, and Managed account (<abbr title="Separately Managed Accts">SMA</abbr>) and (<abbr
                    title="Individually Managed Accts">IMA</abbr>) portfolios consisting of listed
                assets. <br><br>


                <h4> What sets Possible Investments apart?</h4>
                <br> One of our greatest differentiators revolves around regular investment. The concept
                of
                <dfn>dollar-cost averaging</dfn> which is to invest a regular amount each month (ie
                regularly) has
                been around a long time.
                <br> However one of its drawbacks is that most product providers simply set this up on
                the same day
                of each month, or quarter. With Possible Investments, our algorithms allow you to buy on
                the biggest
                dip experienced during the month.<br><br>


                In addition, Possible offer an investment life cycle product. Overtime, if you are committed to
                regular
                investment,
                and your investment grows then your overall holdings will expand accordingly, providing
                greater
                <dfn>diversification</dfn> which means to invest in a wide array of assets or
                investments within a
                portfolio to reduce risk. <br><br>
                <h3>We don't believe that one size fits all</h3> <br><br>We aim to
                offer an entry
                level portfolio, that then matures as your balance is added to and grows with time. See
                table on right for how this actually works, based on particular balances:
