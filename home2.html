                <p>My wife and I last year worked out how
                    to tow a lightweight caravan with our Tesla X75 and
                    now we are all set for sun and surf &#9969; I come by caravanning honestly as during my pre-teen
                    and
                    teenage years, my family and I travelled all 10 Canadian provinces and approximately 44 states
                    in
                    the U.S.A. </p> <br>

                <br><br>
                <h2><b>Fun facts about me</b></h2>
                <h4> Sports</h4><br> My two nicknames growing up were "Sport", and "Iceman". My Mum coined
                the first term, as I was
                the
                youngest of 6, and she could never get me to come in for supper since I would be playing with my
                siblings/neighbours on the cul-de-sac where we lived.
                <br><br>The second nickname was from my basketball coach, Mr March. in the winter of 1982, when he saw
                me
                hit some tough free throws in a close game, and commented: "you must have ice in your veins".
                <br>I have played and coached basketball from the time I was 12 years old. Overall I love many
                sports.
                Lately, I have really gotten into &#9971; however I have an official handicap of 26.4 so I have a
                long
                way to go!
                <br><br><br><br>
                <p>Now my wife and I have our first little grand child: Luca. He is 16
                    months now and here is a photo of all of our lovely family:</p>

                <h4>My Computer Science journey</h4> <br>
                <p>Computers have always intrigued me, and I desired to take
                    a
                    computer science class in Grade 9 (Junior High school in Canada). I was told by my guidance
                    counsellor
                    that I would need to take up a typing class if I was also going to take computer science in my Grade
                    9
                    year. <br> Little did I know that I would end up being 1 of 2 boys in that typing class, just as I
                    was
                    becoming a teen. Suffice to say I enjoyed typing...maybe even more than Computer science! &#x1F609;
                    <br>
                </p> That summer my Dad and sister and I purchased a Commodore VIC20 computer, see image below.

                    <figcaption> Atari Joystick (ii) </figcaption>
                </figure>As a 13 year old I was so excited about this. We didn't do too much programming on
                that VIC20 but
                I fell in love with it, and played certain games on it mostly.
                <br>This was an 8 bit home computer that we bought in the summer of 1981 and I believe that they
                were discontinued
                around 4-5 years later.
                <br>It had an atari joystick port, and since I delivered newspapers...not an easy thing to do in
                Winnipeg, Canada in
                the winter &#x2744;, I saved up and bought a beautiful black and red joystick - the image above.
                Prior to that we had
                to just bash away on various keys! <br>
                The first game I ever bought was called <b>Gorf</b>, a fixed shooter game, and I spent many hours
                with
                my
                friends playing
                that game. <br>
                <h4>Some of the other games I played were </h4>

                <ul>
                    <li> <b>Dig Dug</b> - a maze arcade game</li>
                    <li> <b>Red Alert</b> - a war based fixed shooter game </li>
                    <li> <b>Donkey Kong</b> - a well known game that spanned many generations, cultures, and genres
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Hobby: Travel</h4> Overseas Travel is also a major passion, and I proposed to my wife in
                this
                little place in coastal
                Brazil, which is located around 1,100 <abbr title="Kilometres">km</abbr> (680 miles) north east
