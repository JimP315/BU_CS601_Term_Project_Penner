### Steps to get this Term Project Working:
## Now that I have updated the Term Project, here is the update of how you can get the client Todo working: ##
For the todo list for client with Vue and the add and delete buttons, the files associated with this are:
1. todo.html;
2. main1.js;
3. style.css; also
4. Component folder, and in that folder are:
5.  Three js files:  todo.js, todoComponent.js and todolist.js.

These all actually flow from How_to_invest.html.  When the client has the radio button input for which state they are in, the submit button will now take them to the first file above:  todo.html and this will then run the todo via vue functionality.
## There is now a hero page, and from this runs the recursion javascript file onto a separate page.  ##
Although this doesnt have the same background, etc with navigation I wanted to show that I had incorporated some maths into the website, as I have always enjoyed maths, and recursion is quite challenging. After the hero page is an update on my hobbies of travel, and family, and sports etc. 
## Some of the newer items for the Term Project## are at near the bottom, as I added them late ##
The Template.html file serves to keep consistency for the various HTML 5 coding across these 5 pages. Note that the areas where I have gone above and beyond are in **bold** in the Markdown below

> Open up the File **index.html** although you can open any part of the site, as it has 5 pages:
1. Home;
2. About P3;
3. Portfolios by Possible Investments;
4. How to get started;
5. Investment Philosophy;

 First page of the site has the most content, and I have tried to incorporate all of the requested materials into it for the required marks. Used navigation under HTML 5 so clicking one page, will still provide you access to all others;

### Page:  Home,

I have incorporated nesting, and some of the HTML 5 aspects that I have utilised are as follows:
- Various **emoticons** since this is very standard, and seems worthwhile on a personal, fun facts type page;
- Various breaks so that there is flow from the details on the caravan, to my upbringing to the background of my computer science class and purchase of an early stage home computer, before they became ominpresent;

- Video of my caravan experience by using the *webm file versions of video for greater efficiency and speed in loading to Mozila Firefox*.  I also used a **poster** and some of the learnings from the textbook on how to set up video and have it load once the user clicks it.  Whenever using images, I have followed the protocols suggested regarding the width, and height of the image. This has used **inline** elements
- All images and Assets used in this first page, and all others are held in the folder names for this Homework1_Penner 
- I have used a **map image as instructed in the textbook about HTML map upload** - this obviously is the map of Brazil - & i incorporated **abbreviation for Kilometres**, since metric is used here, not imperial.
- Unordered lists for describing the games I played on the first computer & also a **youtube video** on one of the most famous computer games over many decades.
- For the **acronym for ASIC** when I discuss my P3 FP role, I have referenced the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, when you highlight ASIC 
- Included a **bibliography**, but not sure if this is the way to do it on a web page - this again incorporated an unordered list. 

### Page two:  About P3FP 

- This incorporates a **hyperlink** to my current business webpage, and so since this is my business it doesnt require a reference as I have permission to use; 
- Some unordered list and acronym HTML 5 elements, and another image, this one of  myself in my role. Some italics, and bold as part of an unordered list are some fairly basic HTML 5 elements.

### Page three:  Portfolios

- One of the new elements here is around **definition.**  Dollar cost averaging  & Diversification defined.... it is noted that for Mozilla Firefox this should result in *Italics*. 
- Have incorporated our logo as an image, and another acronym, as Shares and Stocks, are synonymous, however I don't know the function if there is one for incorporating synonyms. 
- Table shows some of the data of some the holdings within the Possible Balanced Growth investments, and that table actually contains some **abbreviations**, including Market cap for Market capitalisation, *again note Australian spelling of this word*, and I have used Australian english in these sites.  Also there are some **acronyms** that are repetive through the **tables** and **ordered lists** ie **block elements** of top/bottom performers, since many people may not know some of the financial lingo...so this is a helpful tool.  Also I have shown Millions of Australian dollars which again allows for abbreviation. 
- You can access the investment philosophy via the **PDF version** on this page; 
- Down the page another **link** to get to the next natural flow to this website, How to Invest, and that is after some of the investment related content for the Possible Managed accounts portfolios. 
- Many investment related sites have disclaimers, as does this one, to ensure that people dont take it as gospel that good performace begats good performance. 

### Page four : How to Invest 

_ I have now updated this page with the Term Project.  This form about where they reside has an action to it.  This will allow for the client to choose where they live, it will then connect to the other projects that i did that were built on Vue and is part of the todo list for the client in submitting their application.  This doesnt have much of the styling that the other pages do, but it is really just a form submission aspect, that will then just say to them, thanks for submitting your form. 

- Initiating a straightforward process for a 10 minute set up.  With CSS we will have tick boxes for each type of account, and *images*, or *infographics* that will flesh this out in terms of the various types of accounts that pertain to Australian investor types; 
- this is in the form of another unordered list; 
- Another **PDF** is included here for an eventual wizard, or survey that will upload a clients responses for their Investment risk tolerance; This will need to eventually be a free flowing 10 question process that the client can revisit. 
- *A form via HTML 5 will be best approach to our Risk Profile determination - not sure if I will be able to complete*
- Have both a**form** and **radio buttons** for a basic account set up and choice of State of residence. 

**Task list:** 

- [x] Code for the Risk profile intro; 
- [ ] Update the actual form for risk questionnaire; 
- [ ] Create table of various portfolio types dependant on Investment amount; 

- Another table shows the actual mix of invsetments, which has a natural flow from lower balances to 


### Page five:  Portfolio reporting 

- This will eventually even include a *log in button*, as this will be for existing clients. 

**Task list:**

-[ ] Need API to actual invsetment platform; 
-[ ] Audio file for monthly reports 
- [x] Want a form that gives clients a choice between one of three reporting periods:  ie a weekly update, a quarterly update or 2, a half-yearly report.  This is now done: **radio button**

### This last item above, will customise an area that typically people have to just take a default of.  Not everyone wants a weekly report, and some people do want more regularity.  

- They will have access to investment/tax reporting that will allow them to simply send to their accountants.  This is not something that is readily available for clients, and we may call it *the shoebox*, since so many people collect their receipts /deductions in a shoe box. 
- An **image** since this type of stuff is very dry and so wanted to make it a tad lighter/funnier with the joke about eggsactly, but this really did occur when I got the number exactly right; 
- A video on some portfolio performance from one of our portfolio colleagues again via **webm** a service that works well on Mozilla as it reduces the time and space taken - this also incorporates a poster for the video so that you have an impressive image/photo not just the start of the video; 
- The aside section here can have a listing of previous quarterly reports, so that people can see how the portfolios compared over past history. 

## Overall I really enjoyed this HW.  I did work on it a bit, and I am completely new to coding ## 
I am completely new to coding, and HTML, and I know that I didnt entirely get the concept about indentation etc, however I am always open to feedback.  Also, in terms of the template, that is a bit lost on me, ie body, and article, and aside, but I am sure that I will get the hang of it.

## For HW2 ##
I wanted to focus mainly on adding a hamburger style menu for navigation, and was able to do that by referencing one of the options that Christian gave us in the live lesson:  https://alvarotrigo.com - there are many responsive hamburger menus there and I was satisfied with what I found and input.  Also, I wanted to prepare the pages for eventual blogs, and I have coded up in the css style sheet to prepare for that. This was from a youtube that I watched: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVOmmc0UTiM also, I wanted to get my head around Grid CSS since it seems really comprehensive and an excellent video that I watched where a lady made it really straightforward:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68O6eOGAGqA This video had nearly 700k views and great feedback, so it was well worth it, and cleared up alot of issues that I had.

I have assigned many pseudo selector code to various elements:  links have both a hover change of color as well as different colors for visited vs unvisited.  I also used :checked for the forms I have built. The **hover** function is used on the Account Establishment/How to invest page, with the click button.

For media queries, each page is impacted such that the Grid CSS forms to 1 single column for mobile phone use, and also, I amended the texts in certain <p> sections to be reduced as screen is reduced.  The background Navigation bar changes color on reduction of screen size as well.

Overall, I know that I need to get greater consistency so that each page looks precisely alike, and that I can get more sense out of the Grid CSS.  I did take many hours of study, youtube, and reading up on many items such as Grid CSS, pseudo selector, and emoticons within HTML, also I have started on form inputs as well in order to understand better how they work.

## Page 1 Hero Page##
This has a neat link to recursion in it, from Eloquent JavaScript.  Click and provide a number, but dont make it too high, ie not above 200 or thereabouts, as it will provide stack overflow.  This runs through a few times, and it eventually leads to similar hamburger menu, but not much styling, it is just to show some javascript with Recursion.
I also made an attempt here to list some other regions of the world I would like to travel to.

## Page 7 trave##
This really was just a lesson in how to set up different images across a Grid to show how you could use a page and have photos overlapping, and level of opacity.

## Page 8 food##
Travel and food go hand in hand, and this is just extra about me and my family and how our heritage impacts what we eat.  Both of Italian and Eastern european backgrounds in our blended family, and so we don't lack for amazing cuisine!

## Vue details ##
following files:  todo.js todoComponents.js todolist.js main1.js style.css todo.html are not part of website but part of vue coding that I did for extra credit.

## Updating DOM ##
Pages that update the DOM are: risk.js; how_to_invest.html, and todolist.js; port.js, port.json.  These are still a work in progress for me since I was travelling during that part of the course, and need to get my head around that a bit.  It was the area of the course that I struggled most in.  Anyways, I can see how it is applicable to what I am trying to build so although I didnt include it in the website, it is still part of what I worked on.
