            In my mind, nothing says summer like the beach! For those who have travelled, you know
            that learning
            the local language, and customs, are pretty
            important.<br> This photo is from Rio De Janeiro. My wife and I tell a funny
            story about when we flew from Rio to Iguazu falls, and it was one of the bumpiest flights we
            have ever
            taken, so to ease the stress mid-flight, I made jokes with my wife about how I had struggled
            with
            Portugese, and was happy to be going
            to a country that spoke Spanish. You will see in my bio that my wife and I have a real
            affinity to the
            beach, and the ocean, and I included photos of our beach history in Homework 6!
            Study in computer sciences is a whole new language, and syntax, and involves much trial and
            error. As I
            embark on this
            journey of computer sciences, after a lifetime in finance, I know that I am in for a rude
            shock as it
            pertains to the steep learning curve.
            <br>
            <p>I hope you enjoy this journey into my details. What you will learn is that I love my family, and
                having them around. Also, I love the great outdoors and adventure, and sports.

            Through my Masters of Software Development Journey, I have learned some incredible new
            things, and
            in particular with this CS601 course, here's a table highlighting areas of learning, what I
            enjoyed, and
            what needs additional effort: <br><br>

            <br>I can be a bit Maths geekish, and therefore something intriguing is called Recursion<br>
            Talk
            about making your head spin...anyways click this link <a href="./recursion.html">Recursion</a> to see
            how it works. This is a
            recursion
            function from an excellent book called Eloquent JavaScript (i), and essentially it allows
            the user to
            input
            a number, and provided the number isnt too high, since that can cause a massive stack
            overflow, you will
            either return a null outcome that means the number chosen couldn't be reached by the
            recursion
            calculation, or it will actually show the equation needed to reach that number...pretty
            cool!<br><br>

            <p><br>The steepest learning curve for me has been the concept of booleans...they've really
                stumped me, so I am focussed
                on gaining greater knowledge there over time. Getting into them is like dealing with a big bowl of
                spaghetti, can get noodles and sauce everywhere!<br><br>
