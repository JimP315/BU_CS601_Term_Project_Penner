            <h3>Sometimes Markets don't do what we want them to</h3><br><br>
            <p>I know that sounds rather intuitive, but we have a solution for those of you who have a significant
                other, or
                investment partners that you may need to have some hard and fast discussions with if markets work
                against
                you. <br>
                It's about getting on the same page. So have a listen to each of our audio genius below. These are a
                list of responses that you may want to practice at the end of a hard,
                and
                potentially painful work/investment day. Then, before you have to break some bad news, just make sure
                the receiver of that news is in the best possible mind space. One or some of these little tidbits, may
                just do the trick. <br>
                Just select your preferred response, or two fire them up while on your way home and give them a listen.
                <br>
                We know this won't make you wealthier but it may just
                ease
                the pain slightly of a tough day / week on the markets.
